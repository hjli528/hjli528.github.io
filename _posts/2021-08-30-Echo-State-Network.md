## What is Echo State Network?

Echo State Network (ESN) is a class of reservoir computing and is considered as partially-trained neural networks. Three main components of ESN are: input, reservoir, and output, as shown in figure below [1].Unlike conventional neural networks, the input weight matrix $W_{in}$ and reservoir layer weight matrix $W_{x}$ are randomly generated and never changed during training or testing phases of the network. The output layer linearly combines the desired output signal from the high-dimensional hidden layer, and its weights are trained during training process.
